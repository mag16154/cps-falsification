Code commits related to our work on CPS Falsification.

1) matlabNaive folder contains the prelimary work where we manually tried to find the direction for basis vectors based on the distance metric.

2) matlabNN folder contains the code related to using neural network for exploring the state space or learning the system dynamics.

3) pyExploreNN has the code in python to explore state space. There are multiple variants of predicting v and vprime. The description is available on top of each file.
