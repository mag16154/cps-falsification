1) A numeral added as a suffix to the keyword 'linear' is to distinguish among benchmarks with linear dynamics.
2) 2d is for a  2 dimensional system.
3) iter1 represents the code for arrving at an initial state in a large initial set, around which we need to compute the robustness in second iteration.
4) iter2 is for the iteration where we change values along one dimension and keep the values along other dimensions intact.
