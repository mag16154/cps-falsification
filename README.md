# cps-falsification
Code commits related to our work on CPS Falsification.

1) matlabNaive folder contains the prelimary work where we manually tried to find the direction for basis vectors based on the distance metric.

2) matlabNN folder contains the code related to using neural network for exploring the state space or learning the system dynamics.

2a) 'OneLayer' has a neural network setup with just one hidden layer.
2b) 'TwoLayers' setup has two hidden layers in the neural network setup.
